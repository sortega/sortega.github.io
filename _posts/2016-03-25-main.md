No matter how meticulous you are, there are some parts of you program you are
not going to unit test just like some funny nooks and crannies in your furniture
are not reachable by a Roomba.

"Main" is one of those parts. Note the quotes because I don't mean just the main
function but all the code at the entry point of the application that is
responsible for the initial instantiation and wiring[^main]. For a small, simple
program this is just the aforementioned main function but it can represent way
more code.

[^main]: This is a very "Uncle Bob" concept explained at some point in the _Clean Code_ videos

Almost by definition, the so called "main" is the code that glues our
application components and can't be tested independently. Integration tests
aside, this means that we can go guilt-free on having no unit tests for it.
Right?

I won't be writing this entry if that was just the end of the story. There is a
risk associated with knowing that "you are not supposed to test the main":
attaching to it responsibilities that should be tested independently.

The usual suspects are snippets that are born as a line or two at the main
function or class but then grow organically until becoming responsibilities by
themselves: argument parsing, text-based user interaction, reading and writing
configuration or data and, in general, anything adjunct to the domain logic.

The key skill here is knowing when those responsibilities should be extracted
from main and independently tested. This takes experience but, as a rule of
thumb, I would extract anything whose inputs and outputs can't be exhaustively
checked mentally as you read the code.

## Data is your friend

Sometimes we slack in emancipating some responsibility, let's say argument
parsing, because of tricky side effects that get in out way. How to unit test a
function that is supposed to end the process with exit code -1?

    def parse(args: Array[String]): Command = ???

A general strategy that works most of the time is using data to represent the
outcome of a computation. The effects such as terminating the process with a
given exit code are kept separate (and maybe as part of the application main).

    import scalaz.\/
    
    def parse(args: Array[String]): InvalidArguments \/ Command = ???

This way you can easily test that a given command line produces a valid command
or some specific `InvalidArguments` value. Then you might ask the exit status to
the error value or make it executable.

    parse(args).fold(
      command => execute(command),
      error => System.exit(error.code)
    )

## Missing the right abstraction

Sometimes the obstacle is of a different nature: we lack a necessary abstraction.
Paraphrasing Dijkstra, the purpose of abstraction is not to be vague but enabling
us to be precise about something without becoming mired in irrelevant details.

This is the case of the text-based interaction with the console in Java/Scala as
it lacks a standard out-of-the-shelf abstraction for it. Therefore, the path of
least resistance is to directly use the actual console making it difficult to
test.

If we are aware of this the solution is immediate and straightforward. We just
roll our own `Console` interface and provide pluggable implementations tied to
the actual console or to in-memory buffers with testing methods.

    trait Console {
        def in: BufferedReader
        def out: PrintWriter
    }

    object StandardConsole extend Console { ??? }

    class TestConsole extend Console with ShouldMatchers {
        def givenInput(line: String): Unit = { ??? }
        def expectOutputContaining(text: String): Unit = { ??? }
        ???
    }

## In the end, you are supposed to test almost everything

It's a pity that the guilt-free zone of code that should not be unit tested is
very small indeed when we know some tricks. And now you don't have any excuse to
neglect writing those tests.
