We, software developers, are a bit like sharks.  Not in the sense of
blood-seeking Wall Street brokers but in the sense of having a need
for swimming or perishing.  If you stop learning for a short number of
years, the wiggling soup of acronyms that populates our environment
will become total gibberish[^1].

We can learn on the job or in our free time although the former can be
rather career-limiting unless it is complemented with the latter.
Apart from reading books and posts, one of the most enriching things
to do by yourself is known as deliberate practice: tackling problems
focusing on what you want to get better at.

In my case, I work periodically on deliberate-practice exercises that
get proposed in a mailing list of dev-minded friends of mine.  I have
observed that people tend to propose problems too big in scope and
finally drop the initiative.  People overestimate what can be done in
hours or days and greatly underestimate what can be done in weeks or
months so you can understand why the scope problem happens.

However, problems are not intended to be completed in just one sitting,
even the ones with a reasonable size and this is an important trigger
for procrastination.

I recently learned in the book of Oakley about learning[^2] that
product-orientation, thinking on the complete products of our work, is
way more to procrastination and quitting than process-orientation,
focusing on the small steps driving us towards task completion.  This
means that we are having a difficult time without deliberate practice
unless we manage our tendency to procrastinate.

What can we do about it?  As
[Scott Young proposes](http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2015/01/29/projects-or-habits/),
it makes sense to convert our side projects into habits and reap the benefits
of process orientation.  All sorts of tricks can help, like self-imposing peer
pressure by working in groups or gamifying techniques like 
[HabitRPG](https://habitrpg.com/), an RPG-like "game" in which you lose HP
points when not completing your tasks and gain XP ones when you do.

In the end this is a very personal subject and everyone should try and
find out his own responses.
