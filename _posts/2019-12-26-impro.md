Why are some conversations engaging, smoothly moving from point to point while
others die off in a couple of round-trips and a final monosyllable? Why can you
rapidly build chemistry with some people and have false starts with
others?

Lately I've been taking some improvisation theater classes, *improv* for
connoisseurs, and the experience has shed some light on these questions and
proven useful for the *real-life world&#8482;*.

First, improv is more about self-expression and play than about performing theater
in front of an audience, at least at the amateur level.  Your typical class
has an initial warm-up phase in which some exercises wake you up by
physically moving, interacting, or maybe shouting and then you play some
games in which you practice the different skills you need to improvise scenes.
Finally, you play some improvisation games in which everything is
unpredictable but within some guidelines.

For example, one popular improv game called the statues consists of having 
someone freeze in a pose and then a new actor steps in and starts a scene
somehow using such a pose to justify it.  At some random point, the teacher will clap
and both actors will freeze.  Then the cycle restarts when a third actor
replaces one of the frozen ones.  This exercise is a constant surprise as
the photo finish of a scene that started with skiing becomes a
do-you-wanna-marry-me one and so on.

This game is representative of elements in improv: some structure or rules,
a ton of unpredictability, a sense of building something together and the joy
of letting yourself play like you were a child again.

As I'm a total *noob* and the course is introductory, we focus on the
fundamentals that can be summarized as accepting and adding or with the motto
*yes and...*.  This was surprising to me as I was expecting something more
related to acting but it makes a lot of sense.  Usually you improvise in
pairs or bigger groups and when someone proposes something it's of paramount
importance to be generous and selfless in order to *accept* that proposal, not doing
so breaks the flow and destroys the spirit of the game. In improv's jargon it's
called *negation* and recognizing and avoiding it is one of the first things 
you are taught.

Negation is the ultimate wet-blanket. Imagine that one actor braces herself
and say "It... it's veery cold up here in the mo-mountain"; then the other 
negates her with "I'm a fish in the ocean."  The first actor will be
disoriented not knowing what to do... even angry at her companion.

Compare this with the opposite to negation: accepting and building on top of that.
"It... it's veery cold up here in the mo-mountain" followed by "Don't falter
now that we are so close to top of the Everest and to win *the bet*". Now, the
first actor can fill in more details about that enigmatic bet.

Apart from having learned some jargon like negation, PROL[^prol], bouncing;
and from having had a ton of fun I got a lesson to apply back to my regular
life: *yes and...* is the missing ingredient to make conversations more
engaging and to build chemistry faster in some other situations. Think about
this: who do you prefer to go on in a holiday trip with? With someone that accept
other's proposals and build on top of them or with someone that
systematically rejects anything but his or her own verbatim will?
