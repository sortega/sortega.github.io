An automatic formatting tool is better than quibbling at formatting issues in pull requests. Why
paying attention to something that can be automatically minded for? **Can't someone else do it?**
That's the reason we use [scalafmt][scalafmt] where I work.

[scalafmt]: https://scalameta.org/scalafmt/

<div style="margin: 1em 0; text-align: center">

         alt="Homer Simpson touting: 'Can't SOMEONE else DO it?'"
         style="width: 50%"/>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 90%">
    Why formatting the code yourself when someone else can do it (automatically)?
    </p>
</div>

Now IntelliJ has direct support for scalafmt, not so long ago I needed to use a separate plugin for
that. But there is a small problem. There are small corner cases in which the IDE-triggered reformat
doesn't reformat stuff than the SBT-triggered one would do. Therefore, from time to time, the
Jenkins build complains about my pull requests for having files incorrectly formatted...

## Not anymore!

Let's remove the frustration of needed to wait again for the Jenkins build from time to time!
(This instructions are tailored for OS X, feel free to replace `brew` with `apt-get` or equivalent
for your system).

First, we are installing [nailgun][nailgun], a protocol and server that solves the problem of long
initialization times for JVM executables. With nailgun you have a background JVM process that is
already started and ready to execute scalafmt or any other program with nailgun support. 

[nailgun]: http://www.martiansoftware.com/nailgun/

```bash
$ brew install nailgun
```

Then, we are installing scalafmt standalone with nailgun support so that we can reformat or check
formatting from other scripts:

```bash
$ sudo coursier bootstrap --standalone org.scalameta:scalafmt-cli_2.12:2.0.1 \
  -r sonatype:snapshots \
  -o /usr/local/bin/scalafmt_ng -f --main com.martiansoftware.nailgun.NGServer
```

To guarantee that the server is always running whenever we login we can use a [launchd][launchd]
agent (launchd is the evolution and replacement of initd in the Darwin family of Unix). To do so,
we should create `~/Library/LaunchAgents/scalafmt_ng.plist` with this contents:

[launchd]: https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/Introduction.html

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" 
          "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
  <key>KeepAlive</key>
  <true/>
  <key>Label</key>
  <string>scalafmt_ng</string>
  <key>ProgramArguments</key>
  <array>
    <string>/usr/local/bin/scalafmt_ng</string>
  </array>
  <key>RunAtLoad</key>
  <true/>
</dict>
</plist>
```

If we restart our session or run `launchctl load scalafmt_ng.plist` the nailgun server will be
ready for service.

Finally, we can write a [git hook][hook] to check that our files are properly formatted:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
set -e
# Check but don't reformat sources with scalafmt
ng org.scalafmt.cli.Cli \
    --non-interactive --quiet \
    --git true \
    --test \
    -c .scalafmt.conf \
    --exclude target \
    `find . -iname scala -type d | grep -v target | grep -v bloop`
```

[hook]: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks

I have this file at `~/.githooks/scalafmt-check` to avoid duplication. To enable these checks for
a repo I simply link it to the pre-commit and pre-push hooks:

```bash
$ cd repo
$ ln -s ~/.githooks/scalafmt-check .git/hooks/pre-commit
$ ln -s ~/.githooks/scalafmt-check .git/hooks/pre-push
```

Now we can instantly know whether we are trying to commit/push code that is not well formatted:

```bash
$ git commit -a -m"Test commit"
Looking for unformatted files...
All files are formatted with scalafmt :)
```

If you prefer to reformat on commit you can go with almost the same script excluding the `--test`
flag.

## The moral of the story

Remove frustration and friction from your daily life. You'll be happier and more productive!
