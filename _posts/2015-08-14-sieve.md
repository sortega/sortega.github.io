It is likely that the first formal algorithm you ever learned was the
Eratosthenes sieve.  It is both easy and convenient for teaching children how
to find the prime numbers under an upper bound.

You just need to prepare a table will all numbers between 2 and N and,
methodically, look at the first uncrossed number, declare it the next found
prime and cross out all its multiples until you run out of numbers.  Take a
look at [this implementation][Sieve.scala] or just delight yourself with this
wonderful visualization by [Peter Grill][peter].

We can take this sieve as an example of sequential algorithms that need to be
rethought if we want to take advantage of multiple threads of execution.  This
is important because during the last several years
[the computing power of a single thread has stagnated][freelunch].  However,
CPUs are still growing in computing power by getting more and more cores over
time[^parallella].

[^parallella]: Do you want 18 cores for less than 100$? [Here.][parallella]
[parallella]: https://www.parallella.org/board/

At the current pace of change in the hardware space, the bottleneck for
harnessing this computing power is going to be the scarcity of developers with
knowledge on concurrency and parallelism and the use of inadequate tools and
languages.

One of the paradigms that can be handy for this purpose is the [actor
model][actormodel]. It can be summarized as an extension to object
orientation[^kay] in which objects run concurrently and the messages (method
invocations) among them are asynchronous: every actor has a mailbox and
process its messages one-by-one.  In other words, this model has the property
of having explicit parallelism built into it.  Hewitt [explains it][hewitt]
way better than me.

[^kay]: This is surprisingly close to how [Alan Kay][kay] originally described the object orientation.

Lets look at the Eratosthenes sieve through the actor model lenses looking for
parallelization.  We should replace the big table of numbers by a series of
actors sending messages and doing work in parallel.  One way to do it is to
create a chain of actors that is fed with all the candidate numbers from 2 to
N.  The first number an actor receive become its prime number P and, from that
point on, the following candidates are discarded when divisible by P and
passed to the next actor otherwise.

We can code this in very few lines using Scala and Akka
([listing][SimpleSieve.scala]). We just need to create a class extending
`Actor` whose initial behavior is specified by pattern matching in the
`receive` method.

[SimpleSieve.scala]: https://gist.github.com/sortega/9e378695474d2f27d03d

    class Filter extends Actor {

      private var prime: Int = _

      override def receive: Receive = {

        case NoMoreCandidates =>
          println("No more candidates")
          println(s"Spent just ${System.currentTimeMillis() - start} millis")
          System.exit(0)

        case firstCandidate: Int =>
          prime = firstCandidate
          println(s"$prime found")
          context.become(filtering(context.actorOf(Props[Filter])))
      }

      private def filtering(successor: ActorRef): Receive = {
        case candidate: Int if candidate % prime == 0 => // Drop candidate
        case other => successor ! other
      }
    }

This actor is waiting for a number (`firstCandidate`) to keep it as a newly
found prime and then switches to the filtering behavior in which it drops any
multiple of `prime` and pass along anything else.  The chain of actors grows
every time a new prime is found so the potential for parallelism grows over
time.

Another notable thing is the sentinel value `NoMoreCandidates`, just a simple
case object, used to coordinate an orderly execution stop.

    case object NoMoreCandidates

The rest of the program is just creating the first actor and feeding it with
the candidate numbers.

    val MaxNumber = 500000
    val start = System.currentTimeMillis()
    val system = ActorSystem("sieve")
    val sieve = system.actorOf(Props[Filter])
    (2 to MaxNumber).foreach(sieve ! _)
    sieve ! NoMoreCandidates
    system.awaitTermination()

This implementation is short, clear and has the nice property of using the
100% of my four cores for about 110 seconds but has some problems.  One of
them is related with the initialization code sending 500001 messages as fast
as it can produce them.  This can produce awkward spikes in memory
consumption and problems with the receiver actor inbox. Another related
problem is the overhead of sending so much messages compared with just
comparing the remainders of the candidates and the already found primes.

We can solve the first problem and mitigate the second by introducing
backpressure and grouping the candidate numbers in chunks.  Backpressure is,
no more, no less, letting the intermediate elements of a distributed system to
provide rate-adjusting feedback.  There are many ways to do it like the TCP
send window but for this example we will use the following rules:

 * Filter actors won't send candidates until explicitly asked for it by its
   successor in the chain by the new message `GetCandidates`.
 * Filter actors will keep asking for candidates and filtering the results
   until having at least `MinChunkSize` candidates.
 * We will have an additional candidate generator actor able to understand the
   `GetCandidates` message and sending the candidates in chunks of size
   `DefaultChunkSize`.

Implementing takes three times as many lines of code and introduces many
subtle details to sort out but the execution time plummets one order of
magnitude to just 18 seconds.  I am not discussing the resulting code line by
line to keep this post short but you can take a look at the [complete
listing][BackPressureSieve].

What about the communication overhead problem? For the same first 500k numbers
it takes 900ms so this parallelization strategy is not very good for this
problem. Communication time dominates because I have just 4 cores and the
basic steps are very simple.

But don't despair as lessons learned are greatly valuable: we should expect
confronting more computing-intensive problems with thousands of cores at our
disposal in the following years.
