We, developers, never stop learning[^1] and we do it from disparate sources.
Apart from learning by [pairing][pairing], from code reviews, copy-pasting
snippets from [Stack Overflow][so], online tutorials and asking a friendly
coworker we rely on books.

As a medium, books have great strengths that other media lack.  A good book on
a technology you want to master will have an introduction providing more
context than any fast response on a QA site, it will be a more thorough
reference that your coworker as it will be written by a presumably world-class
expert on the subject.

What are the cons?  On one hand, a book will demand some time and focus from
you, so don't expect solving your mission-critical burning bug by leaving
through a chapter on that topic.

On the other hand, what you read, even if deeply understood, will dissipate
from your memory pretty fast if you just read it.  Think about a technical
book you read last year or before and try to recall their main points to make
you feel pretty uneasy about it.

As Scott Young explains in [his blog][remember], there is a big difference
between recognizing what you have read before and being able to recall it. You
can improve recall by being more active when reading:

 * *Lookahead and recall while reading*. Skim section titles, figures and
   highlighted sentences of the chapter you are about to study to
   contextualize what you read. Then, after reading a section or a page, close
   the book and ask yourself, "what is the main point of what I'm reading?"
 * *Take notes.* Write the very same questions you ask yourself as notes for
   further study. Just writing them down helps with memorization but you can
   nail them to your brain by using spaced-repetition systems like
   [Anki][anki].
 * *Practice what you read.* This is no always possible, at least on the short
   term, but there [deliberately practicing][practice] what you have read is
   paramount to check your understanding and make it more memorable.

Paraphrasing George Santayana, "Those who cannot remember the key ideas of
their books are condemned to reread them."


[^1]: Almost by definition. If you stop learning you become a non-developer rather fast.
