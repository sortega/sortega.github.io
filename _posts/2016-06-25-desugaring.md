Case classes and objects are the bread and butter of daily Scala programming
and, therefore, an important topic for the newcomer programmer. It has dawned
on me that a nice way to understant the concept of case class and what the
compiler provides automatically is to rewrite it as if the `case` keyword
didn't exist.

You can clone [this repo][repo] and work this exercise in your next session of
Scala deliberate practice.

Enjoy!
