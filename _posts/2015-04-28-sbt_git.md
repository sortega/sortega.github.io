Despite having an IDE and graphical tools, I usually have several--maybe too
many--terminals while programming in Scala.  The bare minimum consists of a
tab running SBT and another one with a regular shell to perform the usual git
rituals.

The problem with this otherwise lovely scheme is that switching back and forth
between tabs, while reasoning about why a test is failing or how to frame the
next commit, is error prone.  More often than I would like to admit this is
the result:

    > git status
    [error] Expected ID character
    [error] Not a valid command: git (similar: exit, plugin, set)
    [error] Expected project ID
    [error] Expected configuration
    [error] Expected ':' (if selecting a configuration)
    [error] Expected key
    [error] Not a valid key: git (similar: dist, npt, ivySbt)
    [error] git status
    [error]    ^
    >

This feeling cannot be easily described with words.

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: center; margin: 1em 0">
    <img src="/assets/sbt_git/not_simply.jpg"
         alt="One does not simply 'git status' into SBT" />
</div>

Feeling the same? Worry not, because some nice people have created
[sbt-git](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-git) a plugin that provides a git
command within SBT.  In short:

    > git status
    [info] On branch release-0.8
    [info] nothing to commit, working directory clean
    >

You can enable it by adding the following line to
`~/.sbt/0.13/plugins/plugins.sbt`:

    addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.sbt" % "sbt-git" % "0.8.0")
